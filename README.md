### Get to know me!
From immigrant to Software Engineer. My life hasn't exactly painted a straight trajectory, but all my past experiences and failures helped build the person I am today.


Hi! 👋

I'm Aldo, and I am passionate about positively impacting the world through technology. I create content on YouTube, write the occasional blog, dust the Twitter account when I feel so moved, and spend a lot of my time teaching and mentoring. Nice to meet you!
