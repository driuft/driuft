<h2 align="center">🌴 Miami-based mobile software engineer w/ large-scale deployment experience</h2>
<br>

### Get to know me!
I was born in Havana, Cuba, and came to the United States when I was nine years old. My interest in technology sparked at a very young age, as I spent time with my father fixing old radios and NES consoles in Cuba. Ever since, I learned the value of seeking knowledge and pretty much sponged up as much as I could, from music to philosophy to history, even cybersecurity, etc.

I carry that same stride with everything I do, soaking up as much information as I can and doing my best to share the knowledge with others. I am a HUGE fan of open-source projects and try to contribute where I can.

It's a pleasure to meet you! 🤝
